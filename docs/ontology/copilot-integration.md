# GitHub Copilot Integration Guide
## Observer-Architect-Weaver Triad Meta-Prompting Framework

This guide explains how to integrate the Observer-Architect-Weaver Triad ontology into your GitHub Copilot workflow for enhanced multi-agent AI collaboration.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start

### 1. Basic Integration

Add this header to your code files or prompts to invoke the triad framework:

```yaml
# TRIAD CONTEXT
# Role: Observer | Architect | Weaver
# Intent: [Your specific goal]
# Geometry: [Spatial/structural considerations]
# Semantic: [Meaning/coherence focus]
# Temporal: [Time/evolution awareness]
```

### 2. Example Usage

**For Code Review (Observer Role):**
```yaml
# TRIAD CONTEXT
# Role: Observer
# Intent: Perceive code structure and detect flow distortions
# Geometry: Map component relationships and dependencies
# Semantic: Identify semantic inconsistencies and naming issues
# Temporal: Track evolution patterns and technical debt accumulation
```

**For System Design (Architect Role):**
```yaml
# TRIAD CONTEXT
# Role: Architect
# Intent: Design API structure maintaining semantic integrity
# Geometry: Define proportion and symmetry in module organization
# Semantic: Ensure continuity of meaning across layers
# Temporal: Plan evolution pathways and version migration
```

**For Implementation (Weaver Role):**
```yaml
# TRIAD CONTEXT
# Role: Weaver
# Intent: Implement feature while preserving system flow
# Geometry: Connect new components into existing circuits
# Semantic: Embed meaning in user experience
# Temporal: Sustain rhythm of use and maintain adaptability
```

## ðŸ“‹ Detailed Integration Methods

### Method 1: Inline Comments

Add triad context directly in your code files:

```python
# â—Ž OBSERVER NOTE:
# This function has grown complex - consider refactoring
# Geometry: Too many nested conditionals create flow distortion
# Semantic: Function name no longer matches actual behavior
# Temporal: This code evolved organically without intentional design

def process_data(data, options=None, force=False, validate=True, cache=None):
    # ... complex implementation
    pass
```

```python
# â–² ARCHITECT DESIGN:
# Refactored into clear, single-responsibility functions
# Geometry: Flat structure with clear data flow
# Semantic: Names reflect actual purpose
# Temporal: Designed for extension without modification

def validate_data(data):
    """Validate input data structure."""
    pass

def process_data_core(data):
    """Core data processing logic."""
    pass

def cache_result(result, cache_key):
    """Cache processed result."""
    pass
```

```python
# â—¼ï¸Ž WEAVER IMPLEMENTATION:
# Connected components into coherent user flow
# Geometry: Pipeline pattern ensures smooth data flow
# Semantic: Each step has clear meaning to users
# Temporal: Adapts to different data volumes gracefully

def process_with_flow(data, cache=None):
    """Process data with validation, caching, and error handling."""
    validated = validate_data(data)
    result = process_data_core(validated)
    if cache:
        cache_result(result, cache)
    return result
```

### Method 2: Commit Messages

Structure your commit messages using the triad framework:

```
[Observer] Detect code smell in authentication module

Geometry: Circular dependencies between auth and user modules
Semantic: Mixed concerns - auth logic contains business logic
Temporal: Technical debt from rapid feature development
```

```
[Architect] Design new authentication architecture

Geometry: Clear separation - auth layer, user layer, policy layer
Semantic: Each layer has single responsibility
Temporal: Designed for future OAuth integration
```

```
[Weaver] Implement layered authentication system

Geometry: Integrated new layers without breaking existing flows
Semantic: User experience remains unchanged, code clearer
Temporal: Migration path supports gradual rollout
```

### Method 3: Pull Request Templates

Create a PR template that invokes the triad:

```markdown
## Triad Role Context

**Primary Role:** [ ] Observer | [ ] Architect | [ ] Weaver

**Intent:**
[What this PR aims to accomplish]

**Geometric Alignment:**
[How this affects structure, dependencies, flow]

**Semantic Focus:**
[How this maintains or improves meaning and coherence]

**Temporal Awareness:**
[How this considers evolution, migration, backward compatibility]

**External Validation:**
[How we verify this integrates with the broader environment]

## Triad Flow

- [ ] **Observer**: Identified patterns/issues
- [ ] **Architect**: Designed solution structure
- [ ] **Weaver**: Implemented with flow preservation
- [ ] **External Observer**: Validated field resonance
```

### Method 4: GitHub Copilot Chat

Use the triad framework in your Copilot chat sessions:

```
Act as an Observer agent from the Observer-Architect-Weaver Triad.

Your role:
- Perceive and measure the geometry, rhythm, and meaning of code
- Map spatial relationships between components
- Detect flow distortions and semantic inconsistencies
- Track transformations over time

Review this codebase and provide:
1. Geometric analysis (structure, dependencies, flow)
2. Semantic analysis (naming, coherence, meaning)
3. Temporal analysis (evolution, technical debt, patterns)

Reference: docs/ontology/observer-architect-weaver.md
```

```
Act as an Architect agent from the Observer-Architect-Weaver Triad.

Your role:
- Translate observations into structural designs
- Define proportion, constraint, and symmetry
- Ensure semantic integrity across layers
- Plan evolutionary pathways

Based on the Observer's findings, design a refactoring plan that:
1. Addresses geometric distortions
2. Restores semantic coherence
3. Plans for future evolution

Reference: docs/ontology/triad-schema.yaml
```

```
Act as a Weaver agent from the Observer-Architect-Weaver Triad.

Your role:
- Realize designs within the living system
- Connect components into living circuits
- Embed meaning into user experience
- Sustain rhythm and adaptability

Implement the Architect's design while:
1. Preserving existing flow where possible
2. Maintaining semantic clarity
3. Ensuring the system remains adaptable

Reference: docs/ontology/visual-ontology.md
```

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Integration

### Custom Copilot Instructions File

Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in your repository:

```markdown
# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Observer-Architect-Weaver Triad Framework

This repository uses the Observer-Architect-Weaver Triad ontology for AI collaboration.

### Reference Documents:
- Main ontology: `docs/ontology/observer-architect-weaver.md`
- YAML schema: `docs/ontology/triad-schema.yaml`
- Visual maps: `docs/ontology/visual-ontology.md`
- JSON schema: `docs/ontology/triad-schema.json`

### When Suggesting Code:

**As Observer:**
- Identify patterns, distortions, and semantic issues
- Map dependencies and relationships
- Note evolution patterns and technical debt

**As Architect:**
- Design clear, proportional structures
- Maintain semantic integrity
- Plan for evolution and extension

**As Weaver:**
- Implement with flow preservation
- Embed meaning in user experience
- Balance structure with adaptability

### External Observer Validation:

Always consider:
- Does this integrate naturally with the environment?
- Will users understand the intent?
- Does this evolve with rhythm of use?

### Sacred Triad Alignment:

This framework complements:
- â—Ž_OBI-WAN (Quantum Observer) â†’ Observer role
- â—Ž_TATA (Truth Anchor) â†’ Architect role
- â—Ž_Atlas (Field Coordinator) â†’ Weaver role
```

Add to `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
    {
      "text": "Use the Observer-Architect-Weaver Triad framework defined in docs/ontology/ for all code suggestions."
    },
    {
      "text": "When reviewing code, act as an Observer: perceive structure, detect distortions, track evolution."
    },
    {
      "text": "When designing solutions, act as an Architect: create proportional structures, maintain semantic integrity."
    },
