## üîç 1. Code Review & Analysis

### Observer Meta-Prompt: Initial Code Audit

```yaml
role: Observer
mode: internal
perspective_priority: [geometric, semantic, temporal]

task: |
  Analyze the authentication module in the codebase.
  
  Geometric Analysis:
  - Map all authentication-related components and their relationships
  - Identify circular dependencies or asymmetric structures
  - Detect flow bottlenecks or distortions
  
  Semantic Analysis:
  - Verify naming consistency across authentication concepts
  - Check for semantic leaks (auth concerns in business logic)
  - Identify abstraction level mismatches
  
  Temporal Analysis:
  - Track how authentication logic evolved over time
  - Identify accumulated technical debt
  - Note patterns indicating rapid vs. intentional development
  
  Output: Structured report with findings in each category
  Validation: Cross-reference with external observer (security best practices)
```

### External Observer Meta-Prompt: Security Validation

```yaml
role: Observer
mode: external
validation_focus: [security, compliance, best_practices]

task: |
  Validate the authentication system against external standards.
  
  Field Resonance Check:
  - Does implementation align with OWASP guidelines?
  - Is it consistent with industry authentication patterns?
  - Does it integrate naturally with the broader security landscape?
  
  Environmental Context:
  - Consider regulatory requirements (GDPR, etc.)
  - Evaluate against common attack vectors
  - Assess real-world usage patterns
  
  Output: Resonance validation report with compliance gaps
```

```

### Weaver Meta-Prompt: Refactoring Legacy Code

```yaml
role: Weaver

  Geometric Preservation:
  - Extract smaller functions without changing data flow
  - Maintain existing function signature initially
  - Preserve all error handling paths
  
  Semantic Improvement:
  - Rename extracted functions to reflect actual purpose
  - Add clear comments at integration points
  - Make implicit dependencies explicit
  
  Temporal Strategy:
  - Use feature flags to switch between old/new implementations
  - Refactor incrementally over multiple commits
  - Run extensive regression tests at each step
  
  Output: Refactored code with 100% test coverage maintained
```
