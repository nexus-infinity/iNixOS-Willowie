## 🎉 Congratulations!

If you've checked off all the critical items above, your iMac 2019 is now running a fully functional NixOS system with the iNixOS-Willowie sacred geometry configuration!

Your system should:
- ✅ Boot natively from internal drives (no USB)
- ✅ Have a responsive desktop environment
- ✅ Be able to update and rebuild declaratively
- ✅ Have proper storage separation (if using Fusion Drive strategy)
- ✅ Be stable and reliable for daily use

**Next Steps:**
1. Customize your desktop environment to your preferences
2. Install additional applications as needed
3. Explore the chakra system architecture
4. Consider implementing the stub services (Atlas, DOJO, etc.)
5. Keep your configuration in sync with GitHub

**Remember:** NixOS is declarative and reproducible. Any changes you make should be in the configuration files, committed to Git, and applied with `nixos-rebuild switch`. This ensures your system remains consistent and recoverable.

Happy computing with your iMac 2019 and iNixOS-Willowie! 🌀
