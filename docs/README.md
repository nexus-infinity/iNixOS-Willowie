# FIELD — docs index

This directory contains short, focused documentation describing the internal interactions
between the major components in the FIELD architecture (chakras, OBI‑WAN, DOJO, ATLAS, TATA)
and practical runbooks for the local environment.

Files:
- docs/chakras/README.md — per-chakra responsibilities and where their configs live
- docs/soma/mole-protocol.md — Mole: coherence detection, baton emission and how to run tests
- docs/provenance/baton-lifecycle.md — baton schema, events, OBI‑WAN log conventions
- docs/runbooks/repair-and-coherence.md — how to run repair_and_backup.sh, mole checks, and inspect OBI‑WAN events
